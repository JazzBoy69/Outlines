        <div class="heading">WHAT IS TRUE JOY? <span class="time">(0:00-3:00)</span></div>
        <div class="level-1">We are here because we want to <b>serve Jehovah.</b> But since are living in critical times that are hard to deal with, is it resonable to expect that we can <b>serve Jehovah with joy?</b> It is not reasonable to think that we will always feel cheerful and elated when we are under trial. (Heb 12:11)</div>
        <div class="quote secondary">
            no discipline seems for the present to be joyous, but it is painful
        </div>
        <div class="level-1">What joy is</div>
        <div class="level-2">
            Joy is the deep sense of happiness caused when 1) we have something good or 2) we have the hope of receiving something good.
        </div>
        <div class="level-3">
            1) Happiness caused by the <b>hope</b> of receiving something good. If we have proof that our hope of receiving something good will be realized, that is <b>faith.</b> So, true joy is related to hope and faith.
        </div>
        <div class="comment">
            <p>When discussing faith, Paul said: “For the joy that was set before [Jesus] he endured a torture stake.” </p>
            <p>For Jesus the pain of the torture stake was not in itself a reason for rejoicing. </p>
            <p>Rather, the joy was in the hope that was set before him. </p>
            <p>In our case, by looking ahead with faith to the fulfillment of God’s promises we may be able to “consider it all joy” even when we meet with the most trialsome situations.—Jas 1:2-4.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="level-3">
            2) Happiness caused by receiving something good
        </div>
        <div class="level-3">
            In the Sermon on the Mount Jesus said: “Happy are you who weep now, for you will laugh.”
        </div>
        <div class="comment">
            Their mourning is sadness over their own sinful state and the conditions existing because of human imperfection. Because they exercise faith in God and Christ and are comforted by having a good relationship with Jehovah, Jesus’ followers are happy.

        <div class="comment">
            Our expressions of praise should be strong, like when a victorious army <b>‘shouts in triumph.’</b>
            People of <b>“all the earth,”</b> from all nations are now rejoicing as they serve Jehovah. 
            <b>“Serve Jehovah with rejoicing.”</b> Joy must be a feature of our service to God.
            The psalmist urged people to come into God’s presence <b>“with joyful shouting”</b> because if we appreciate the priviledge of serving God, that is, if we really think that we <i>have aquired something good</i> by coming to know Jehovah and doing his will, we will have a deep sense of happiness.

            TWO REASONS SERVING JEHOVAH BRING US JOY <span class="time">(4:00-8:00)</span>
        </div>
        <div class="comment">There are things that may properly bring us joy (house, family), but they may be temporary. 
            What is the basis for true, lasting joy? Serving Jehovah is the basis for real, lasting joy. Let’s examine two reasons why that is true.</div>
        <div class="level-1">
            1) We were created to worship God, so we naturally find joy when we put his worship first in our life (Ec 12:13)
        </div>
        <div class="comment">
            <p>Think about this example:</p>
            <p>
                If we were to use shoes that are too small all day, every day we would experience discomfort. 
                But what if we had a pair of shoes that were custom made for our feet? 
                What if the one who made these shoes wanted them to be as comfortable as possible? What a difference!
            </p>
            <p>
                People whose goals are small and ill-fitting, centered around material goals are not living as they should. 
                They are uncomfortable with their lives. Something is missing.
                We were created to <b>“fear the true God and keep his commandments, . . . this is the whole obligation of man.”</b>
                We were custom made to do God’s will, so when we serve Jehovah, we naturally get the most enjoyment from life.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="level-1">
            2) Jehovah gives his servants holy spirit, which helps them to have true joy (Ga 5:22; 1Th 1:6)
        </div>
        <div class="comment">
            <p>In our imperfect state, some of us have to deal with depression and other emotional problems, while others might naturally have a positive outlook and what we might call a sunny disposition. </p>
            <p>However, none of us is born with the kind of joy that we are learning about in this talk; 
                nor does it develop automatically. Why not? Because true joy is part of the fruitage of God’s holy spirit. </p>
            <p>With the help of God’s spirit, we can fully develop “the new personality,” which includes faith, appreciation and joy.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="comment">
            Joy is fueled by God’s spirit. Hence, you will develop greater joy by regularly requesting the help of Jehovah’s spirit and prayerfully meditating on his spirit-inspired Word.

            6 joy of holy spirit

        <div class="heading">JOY BASED ON SERVING JEHOVAH DOES NOT DIMINISH WHEN WE EXPERIENCE PROBLEMS <span class="time">(8:00-12:00)</span> </div>
        <div class="comment">Our joy should be based on using our life to serve Jehovah and fueled by holy spirit. Although our circumstances change, the purpose of our life does not. Though we pass through trials, the power of holy spirit does not diminish</div>
        <div class="level-2">
            Although we may have problems in life, we can still be joyful. Let’s review two examples that show that this is true. One from the first century and a modern-day example.
        </div>
        <div class="comment">
            In the first century the apostles were brutally beaten for speaking about the Christ. Yet, they “went out from before the Sanhedrin, rejoicing because they had been counted worthy to be dishonored in behalf of his name.” (Acts 5:41) Obviously, they were not rejoicing over the beating they had received. They found true joy because they had kept their friendship with Jehovah intact, despite the persecution they were experiencing. They had a deep sense of happiness caused by the receiving something good. They received and kept Jehovah’s friendship and approval even under difficult circumstances
        </div>
        <div class="comment">
            <p><b><i>w01</i> 5/1 pp. 13-14 pars. 1-2:</b></p>
            <p>JAMES, a 70-year-old Christian living in Sierra Leone, had worked hard all his life. Imagine his joy when he had finally saved up enough money to purchase a modest four-room house! Some time after James and his family moved in, however, civil war broke out in that country, and their home was burned to the ground. They lost their house, but they did not lose their joy. Why not?</p>
            <p>James and his family kept their minds focused, not on what they had lost, but on what yet remained. James explains: “Even during the time of horror, we held meetings, read the Bible, prayed together, and shared what little we had with others. We were able to maintain our joy because we focused on the wonderful relationship we have with Jehovah.” By counting their blessings, the greatest of which is having a close personal relationship with Jehovah, these faithful Christians were able to “continue to rejoice.” (2 Corinthians 13:11) Of course, their distressing circumstances were not easy to endure. But they did not cease to rejoice in Jehovah.</p>

        <div class="comment">
            <p><b>Jehovah leads his sheep.</b> Sheep without their shepherd tend to get lost. Similarly, we need help to find the right path in life. Jehovah, explains David, guides his people to <b>“grassy pastures”</b> and <b>“well-watered resting-places.”</b> He leads them <b>“in the paths of righteousness.” (Verses 2, 3)</b> By following the leadings of his spirit as reflected in the Bible, we can pursue a way of life that brings contentment, refreshment, and security.</p>
            <p><b>Jehovah protects his sheep.</b> Without their shepherd, sheep are fearful and helpless. Jehovah tells his people that they need not fear, not even when they <b>“walk in the valley of deep shadow”</b>—during what may seem to be the darkest moments in life. <b>(Verse 4)</b> Jehovah watches over them, ever ready to help them. He can give his worshippers the wisdom and strength they need in order to cope with trials.</p>
            <p><b>Jehovah feeds his sheep.</b> Sheep are dependent on their shepherd to find food for them. We have a spiritual need that can be filled only with God’s help. Thankfully, Jehovah is a generous Provider, arranging before his servants a bounteous table. <b>(Verse 5)</b> The Bible and Bible-based publications are a source of spiritual food that satisfies our need to know the meaning of life and God’s purpose for us.</p>
