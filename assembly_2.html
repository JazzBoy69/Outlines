        <div class="heading">WHY HOSEA NEEDED PATIENCE <span class="time">(0:00-1:00)</span></div>
        <div class="level-1">Hosea prophesied for some 60 years in the ten-tribe kingdom of Israel <span class="backgroundinfo">(jd 18 ¶11; 128-129 ¶9-10)</span></div>
        <div class="comment">
            <p>The Israelites were in a covenant relationship with Jehovah. By Hosea’s time, they had been unfaithful to him for hundreds of years.
                Nevertheless, God was willing to forgive them, provided that they returned to him. 
                Jehovah’s forbearance continued for some 60 more years for Israel!</p>
       </div>
       <div class="level-2">Jehovah instructed Hosea to “marry a woman of prostitution” (Ho 1:2<span class="backgroundinfo">; it-1 1147 ¶1</span>)</div>
       <div class="quote">When Jehovah started to speak his word through Ho·seʹa, Jehovah said to Ho·seʹa: “Go, marry a woman of prostitution and have children of prostitution, because by prostitution the land has turned completely away from following Jehovah.”</div>
       <div class="comment">
            It indicates that the woman would become adulterous and have such children after her marriage to the prophet.
            Gomer later gave birth to a daughter, Lo-ruhamah, and thereafter to a son named Lo-ammi, 
            both evidently being fruits of her adultery. Yet, Hosea was to forgive Gomer.

       <div class="level-3">The purpose of this was to illustrate Jehovah’s patience with His people</div>

        <div class="heading">WHY WE NEED PATIENCE LIKE THAT OF HOSEA <span class="time">(2:00-4:00)</span></div>
        <div class="level-1">What lesson can we learn from what Hosea was required to do?</div>
        <div class="level-2">Jehovah wants us to be patient and to forgive others (Col 3:13)</div>
        <div class="quote">
            Continue putting up with one another and forgiving one another freely even if anyone has a cause for complaint against another. Just as Jehovah freely forgave you, you must also do the same.
        </div>
        <div class="level-3">However, unlike Hosea, who had no choice in the matter, an innocent mate today has the right to decide whether to divorce an adulterous mate</div>
        <div class="level-1">At times, a fellow believer, a close friend, or a relative may hurt us, perhaps even repeatedly (Ps 55:12-14; Mt 18:21, 22)</div>
        <div class="quote">
            For it is not an enemy who taunts me; Otherwise I could put up with it. It is not a foe who has risen up against me; Otherwise I could conceal myself from him. But it is you, a man like me, My own companion whom I know well.14We used to enjoy a warm friendship together; Into the house of God we used to walk along with the multitude.
        </div>
        <div class="quote">
            Then Peter came and said to him: “Lord, how many times is my brother to sin against me and am I to forgive him? Up to seven times?” Jesus said to him: “I say to you, not up to seven times, but up to 77 times.

        <div class="level-1">Like Hosea, we can learn from Jehovah’s example of patience <span class="read">[Read Hosea 3:1]</span> <span class="backgroundinfo">(w05 11/15 20-21 ¶17-19)</span></div>
        <div class="quote">
            Then Jehovah said to me: “Go once again, love the woman who is loved by another man and is committing adultery, just as Jehovah loves the people of Israel while they turn to other gods and love raisin cakes.”
        </div>
        <div class="comment">
            <p>17 God is merciful and compassionate, and that is how we should be. Let us therefore ask ourselves: ‘How can I better imitate Jehovah’s mercy and compassion in my dealings with others? If a fellow Christian who has offended me asks for forgiveness, am I as ready to forgive as God is?’—Psalm 86:5.</p>

       <div class="heading">Hosea took the initiative, just as Jehovah did with His people (Ho 11:4) <span class="time">(9:00-10:00)</span></div>
       <div class="quote">
        With the ropes of men I kept drawing them, with the cords of love; And I was to them like one lifting a yoke from their jaws, And I gently brought food to each one.
       </div>
       <div class="level-2">We may need to take the initiative to make peace (Eph 4:26<span class="backgroundinfo">; w97 12/1 18-19 ¶12-13</span>)</div>
       <div class="quote">
            Be wrathful, but do not sin; do not let the sun set while you are still angry;
       </div>
       <div class="comment">
            <p>What, though, if someone sins against us in a more serious way, deeply injuring us? 
                In such a case, you may need to take some initiative to settle the problem, perhaps by speaking to the offender. 
                Among the Jews, sundown marked the close of one day and the start of a new one. 
                Hence, the advice is: Settle the matter quickly!</p>
            <p>Your objective is not to express anger but to make peace with your brother. 
                Be specific in explaining how you feel about what happened. 
                Give the other person a chance to explain his actions. Listen to what he has to say. 
                Very likely any misunderstanding can be cleared up, appropriate apologies made, and forgiveness extended.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="level-2">We should pray for those who have hurt us (Mt 5:44<span class="backgroundinfo">; w12 11/15 30 ¶15</span>)</div>
      <div class="quote">
        However, I say to you: Continue to love your enemies and to pray for those who persecute you,
      </div>
      <div class="comment">
        If you feel that you have been the victim of an injustice and find it difficult to forgive a wrongdoer who has repented, it would be good to realize that the offender too is a victim. He or she also suffers the effects of inherited imperfection. (Rom. 3:23) Jehovah feels compassion toward all imperfect mankind. Therefore, it is appropriate to pray for the offender. It is unlikely that we would continue being angry with someone for whom we are praying. And that we should avoid harboring resentment toward even those who mistreat us is clear from Jesus’ words: “Continue to love your enemies and to pray for those persecuting you.”​—Matt. 5:44.

      <div class="heading">Jehovah was willing to extend forgiveness if the people repented (Ho 2:2) <span class="time">(10:00-11:00)</span></div>
      <div class="level-2">If someone has not yet repented of sins against us, can we work at letting go of resentment by leaving the matter with Jehovah? (Ps 37:8)</div>
      <div class="quote">
        Let go of anger and abandon rage; Do not become upset and turn to doing evil.
      </div>
      <div class="level-3">Never let another person’s actions damage your relationship with Jehovah</div>
      <div class="level-1">With Jehovah’s help, you can be patient with those whom he loves</div>
