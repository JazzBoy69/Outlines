            <div class="comment">Much of today’s popular entertainment teaches a person to be passive rather than active. Movies, books, and television programs present another person’s creative ideas, not your own. While there is a place for passive entertainment, many have found active entertainment to be more rewarding.</div>
            <div class="level-2">We will consider seven aspects of life in the land of Jesus​—geography, animals, food, homelife, community, education, and worship—​and we will draw valuable lessons from each one</div>

                <p>THE land that God gave to ancient Israel includes an extraordinary variety of geographic features. In the north are snowcapped mountains; areas in the south are tropical. Within its borders are productive lowlands, hill country for orchards and the grazing of flocks, as well as areas of desolate wilderness. Here in a relatively small area is a cross section of geographic features of the earth.</p>
                <p>At its peak, the Promised Land with all its diversity was like the garden of Eden. Israel thus provided a small-scale example of what Paradise under the Kingdom of God will mean for mankind in all parts of the earth.</p>

                Joseph, Mary, and their family “went up” from Nazareth to the Passover festival in Jerusalem​—an arduous journey that took several days (Lu 2:41, 42)
